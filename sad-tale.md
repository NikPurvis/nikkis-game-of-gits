House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned rode all the wolves into battle like Santa with a sleigh pulled by fanged murderous reindeer. He lopped Geoffrey's head off with that fancy sword whose name I can't remember. Everybody cheered. They had a party. There were lemon cakes.
